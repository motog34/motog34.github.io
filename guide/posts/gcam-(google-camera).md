# Ads will be reduced/completely-removed
**This will end or reduce your suffering with ads:**
Input **dns.adguard-dns.com** in
settings > network & internet > private DNS
exactly as it is written, without space anywhere.

**What it does:**
It'll not let the ads to load. Works throughout your phone (and maybe also in the other devices connected to its network, eg through hotspot) that includes: your browser, apps, websites, etc. You'll save your resources, battery, internet and time loading a website or an app.

**How it works:**
Think of DNS as a translator that converts user-friendly URLs into numerical IP addresses. The thing you input is a free adguard DNS. Whenever a URL associated with an ad needs to be translated in order to load the ad, this DNS service effectively renders it null. Typically, ad blocker applications utilize device resources to detect and block ads. By default, users rely on their Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) DNS, so either way, you are using a DNS.

You can find more info on it by searching adguard DNS on google and visiting https://adguard-dns.io/en/public-dns.html
OR

Use Adguard adblock app, It's a much more full fledged solution

For getting rid of YouTube ads you can use alternative clients like [ReVanced](https://t.me/youtuberevancedbuilds) or [Newpipe](https://newpipe.net/)

# Show clock seconds in status bar
![Clock preview with seconds](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motog34/motog34.github.io/refs/heads/main/guide/files/IMG_20241109_010733_354.jpg)

```settings put secure clock_seconds 1```

Default value is 0.

# Show internet speed, daily usage
Want to show internet speed, daily wifi, mobile data usage on the status bar?
Use [DataMonitor](https://github.com/itsdrnoob/DataMonitor/releases) (you have to go to its settings first, just go through all the options and set them as you want).

# Swap “back” and “recents” buttons
Hold on **Settings** app > **Widgets** > add it > **3-button navigation** > open it and enjoy!

Although now they are too close to each other in contrast to default arrangement.
Android had an option in the past to adjust spaces, order, even remove some of the buttons.
